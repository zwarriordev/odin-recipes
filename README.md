# odin-recipes
This is a basic HTML project built as part of The Odin Project curriculum. It consists of a main index page that links to several recipe pages.

## Skills

- writing semantic HTML
- Structuring a multi-page website
- Linking between pages using anchor tags
- Using lists, headings, paragraphs, and images

## Reflection 

This project helped me get comfortable with basic HTML structure and file linking. It's a good foundation before moving on to CSS and JavaScript.
